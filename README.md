Arduino Robot Car (2WD, Ultrasonic Sensor and... more???)

Using this repository to store files for my 2WD Robot Car project.

The car is a kit project (link to come) and the code is.... well, sort of what was provided as an example, but heavily modified by me.

Currently, the car does the following:

- Travels forward
- If it gets closer than 25cm to an object, it will stop, scan left/right, back up and choose a direction to travel
- If it gets closer than 10cm to an object, it will stop and reverse a bit, before doing the above

The supplied example code is pretty much garbage, so I've refactored it a lot and now working on the logic.

I'll update this as and when/if I remember.

Cheers,
Stu
